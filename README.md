# Kimberly Financial Landing Page

## Project Context

Kimberly Financial is a website that I've been working on for Kim's financial institution that she's building. Kim explained the services she provides her clients. I presented a wireframe with the client to gain agreement of the concept. After brainstorming ideas with Kim I designed the website from scratch in Figma to provide a concept. After we agreed on the design I wrote the landing page for her.
